# Climatty

iOS App (Swift 5.1/Xcode 11) - Climatty App was built programmatically, no storyboards. 

## What it does

Climatty is a location-aware weather app. It will detect your location and by using open source API will show the current temperature and weather conditions. Also, you can check the weather in any city if you tap the corresponding button.

## What I used in the app

* CocoaPods: TinyConstraints, SwiftyJSON, Alamofire
* Public web-based APIs to fetch data.
* Core Location 
* Navigation between View Controllers programmatically and passing data between them.
